# Privacy preserving primitives

This repo lists project implementations, designs and papers of primitives and 
protocols aiming at increasing privacy of networked systems. The goal of this
project is to create the go-to directory for developers and system designers to
learn about the existing tools for developing applications which are privacy
preserving.
